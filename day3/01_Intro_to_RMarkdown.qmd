## What is RMarkdown?

:::{.center}
![](../images/rmarkdown.png){width=20%}
:::


- [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a file format and a scripting and author framework to run analyses and generate reports for your analyses. 

- It is a powerful tool for integrating code, results, and narrative into a single, reproducible document.

- You can find more about RMarkdown [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

:::::: columns
:::{.column .smaller .center width="50%"}
- You can generate

    -   html
    -   pdf
    -   word docs
    -   html slides (presentations) - such as this one written, technically, in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/).
    -   handouts
    -   [books](https://bookdown.org)
    -   dashboards ([Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co))
    -   articles
    -   websites

:::{.column .smaller .center width="50%"}

- It is **interactive**
  
  In one place you have:
  - code
  - results
  - annotation and comments


- Allows for **Reproducability**
  - It makes it easy to create reproducible workflows.

# Practical 3.1

## Let's practice !{.smaller}

- We are going to work with the iris data set. 
It is already available when you start R.

- Start a new Rmarkdown file
- Title it: **"My First RMarkdown File"**
- We want to render to HTML
- Describe what you will be doing in this "report". Think about the good coding practices we previously discussed. 
- In your first code chunk ( [Cmd+Option+I] on a Mac) *head()* the iris data set.
- In your second code chunk: use the *apply()* function to estimate the *mean()* of the numeric columns.
- Make a scatter **plot**, illustrating the relationship between *Sepal.Width* and *Petal.Length*. Color each observation by *Species*
- Save your file
- Render your document by clicking on "Knit".

## What should our exercise look like?

My Rmarkdown file, for this exercise, is below and [here](https://github.com/hughesevoanth/intro_to_r/blob/main/day3/My_First_RMarkdown.Rmd).
