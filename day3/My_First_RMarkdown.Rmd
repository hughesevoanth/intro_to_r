```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## This is my first R Markdown file

In this exercise I am **learning** what *R Markdown* can do for me. 

1. What is it capable of doing? 
2. Why should I be using it?

### Head the iris data set

```{r cars}
head(iris)
```

### Estimate the mean of the number columns of iris

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
(m = apply(iris[, 1:4], 2, mean) )
```

<!--An example of some R code in a line of text. -->
- The mean *Sepal.Width* across all observations was **`r round(m[2], digits = 2)`**.

### Plot the relationship between Sepal.Width and Petal.Length

- color my observations by the Species

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5}
plot(iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Petal.Length, col = iris$Species, pch = 19, cex = 1.5,
     xlab = "Sepal Width", ylab = "Petal Length")
```
