## Common Errors

[Noam Ross](https://www.noamross.net) has compiled some common errors for us.

## Common Errors cont'd{.smaller}

Dr. Ross has identified [9604 unique errors](https://github.com/noamross/zero-dependency-problems/blob/master/misc/stack-overflow-common-r-errors.md) in Stack Overflow.

    - The most common are:
  
  | **trigram** | **freq** |
  |:--------------|:---------|
  | not find function  |  311 |
  | Error in if  |  308 |
  | could not find  |  300 |
  | in eval(expr, envir,  |  298 |
  | eval(expr, envir, enclos)  |  291 |
  | envir, enclos) :  |  287 |
  | Error in eval(expr,  |  286 |
  |  = TRUE) :  |  249 |
  | value where TRUE/FALSE  |  239 |
  |  missing value where  |  230 |
  | : cannot open  |  216 |
  | : missing value  |  214 |
  | enclos) : object  |  211 |
  | where TRUE/FALSE needed  |  201 |
  | : unable to  |  194 |

## could not find function

Error: could not find function "some_function" is this most common error. 

  - generally this is a product of misspelling or not loading the necessary library

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_function()  # 'my_function' has not been defined
```

    Error in my_function() : could not find function "my_function"

## Error in if

"Error in if" generally means the logical statement in "if (XXX) { ..." is not yielding a logical value. Most of these have missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed, meaning that the variable in XXX has NA in it.
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- 1:5
if (x) {  # This will generate an error because 'x' is a numeric vector, not a logical value
  print("This won't print")
}
```

    Error in if (x) { : the condition has length > 1

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (NULL) {  # NULL is not a valid logical value for an if statement
  print("This won't print")
}
```

    Error in if (NULL) { : argument is of length zero
  
## could not find

Similar to the issue of "could not find function", but typically an object can not be found. 

  - generally this is a product of not defining an object.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
print(my_variable)  # 'my_variable' has not been defined
```

    Error: object 'my_variable' not found
  
## object of class

This is not in the top list above but is common. 

  - generally the product of trying to run a function on an object of the wrong class.
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- 1:10  # Numeric vector
summary.lm(x)  # `summary.lm()` expects an object of class "lm" (linear model)
```

    Error in z$rank : $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors

## subscript out of bounds

This is another common error and is the product of trying to access an element of a vector or list that is not there.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
m <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)  # A 3x3 matrix
m[4, 2]  # Try to access the 4th row, which doesn't exist
```

    Error in m[4, 2] : subscript out of bounds

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lst <- list(a = 1, b = 2)  # A list with two elements
lst[[3]]  # Try to access the 3rd element, which doesn't exist
```

    Error in lst[[3]] : subscript out of bounds
    
## Most error messages are not helpful

What should you do if the error is not clear?

  - Google
  - Stack Overflow
  - LMM
  
  - Try searching different parts of the error message
  - Run your code line by line to find the error.

## Errors can be challenging

Fret Not: 
<br>
The good news is that there are many ways to solve the problem.
  
  - Ask for help
  - Internet
  - Tear your code apart
  - Try a different approach
