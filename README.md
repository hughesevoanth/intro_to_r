This course heavily leans on the materials developed by University of Bristol ["IEU Introduction to programming using R"](https://github.com/MRCIEU/introduction-to-r/tree/main) short course. 

## Overall aim

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to programming in R, covering the fundamental concepts of the R language. Participants will learn the essentials of writing effective R scripts, data manipulation, and visualization techniques. By the end of the course, attendees will be equipped with the skills needed to create useful scripts and generate visually appealing outputs for data analysis.

## Target audience
This course is for PB students and reseachers with little or no experience in the R statistical software package but who need to use R for data analysis. 

We currently see this course as a **pilot** and would like to limit the course to **15 participants** who would be able to attend the course **in person**. We would also like to limit it to those who are reasonably confident that they can attend all 4 days of the course. We will probably lean towards enrolling graduate students and post-docs but for faculty that are enthusiastic we would love to include you as well. 

Please reach out to David directly if you are really keen on being in the course. 

## Objectives
By the end of the course students will be able to:

1.	Access the R website, download and install R
2.	Implement basic R operations
3. Generate quick plots in base R
4. Write R scripts
5. Troubleshoot errors
6. Read in data, from a varity of data formats
7. Comfortably wrangle their data
8. Comfortably work with RStudio's RMarkdown and Notebook files and much more
9. Work in the tidyverse framework
10. Produce publication ready figures using ggplot2
11. Write their own functions

## Pre-course preparation 

Students should ensure that they have **R** and **RStudio** installed on *their laptop* prior to the course.  Links and instructions for installation can be found [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Only the free desktop version with the Open Source Licence is needed. If there is any need for a laptop or computer to be provided for your participation in the course please reach out to David or Scientific Education at PB <SciEdu@PBRC.EDU>.
